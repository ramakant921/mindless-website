# Maybe A Daily Dashboard 
This is the web page or web development in which me and my buddy will build.

### First we need to get the idea down, we might go with the modified version of idea i came up with or we can go completely *rogue it's upto you

![FigmaDesign](./screenshot/daily_dashboard.png)

# Steps to Start Working
- git pull
- make a account on figma.com then view the concept design i made then evaluate (I've invited you on ramakantm921@gmail.com as a editor so accept that then make
    a duplicate then edit it, but make sure not to edit the original one, I already duplicated it for yuh)
- here's the figma design link (you can also download the file from design directory): [figma_design](https://www.figma.com/design/4j4hUPU2NM0Ztgsyp4xr1i/Mindless_Website?node-id=0-1&t=PPcFgQYwcPzAjUqc-1)
- you will handle most of the html && css stuff
- this is gonna easily take around 2 weeks because i'll be treating it as a side
    project and maybe work 1-2 hr per day on it so you'll have enough time to master
    html && css concept that would be needed to build this
- try to stack javascript so that you can also work on some of the features

## CSS concepts you would need
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Relative Units
- Border Radius
- Css Variables (it makes changing the theme feasible) segregate it as primary, secondary & tertiary color

### [Note] we won't worry about making it responsive cause we can worry about it later
